# newsrecollection


This is some code I used to collect covid related news for two articles/papers. It may be a bit long, but it does the job. In this case, we only have two examples, one for latercera.cl (only R code) and one for emol.cl (Python and R code), but you can use it for any other news media outlet that lets you get the xpaths from the HTML code. In the case of the R code, this may also work even on paywalls. The Python code is different, even when there is a pop up there could be some issues, so you must check the website and its structure before running the code.
